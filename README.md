# sqlalchemy_challenge
In this challenge, I prepare for a hyptohetical trip to Hawaii by running a climate analysis on the destination. This challenge displays use of SQL Alchemy methods including SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to conduct a climate analysis and to explore the database we will create. After conducting the climate analysis, I will design a Flask API weather app based on these queries.
